Univariate time series forcasting model. Predicts future data by analyzing past data. Useful for tasks such as stock prediction or weather forecasting. Included is a potential example usage, forecasting VT stock price data.

Uses a 1d convolutional architecture. Will be able to analyze simple trends in stock prices, but an LSTM would be more powerful for detailed long term predictions.
